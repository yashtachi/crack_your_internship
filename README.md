# Crack Your Internship

Welcome to the "Crack Your Internship" repository, inspired by Arsh Goyal's approach to mastering coding interviews. This repository is designed to be your companion for a 45-day intensive preparation journey towards landing your dream internship. Each day, you will be challenged with coding questions that are essential for acing technical interviews.

## What's Inside?

Inside this repository, you will find a structured 45-day plan. Each day is dedicated to specific coding problems that cover a wide range of topics, from data structures and algorithms to system design. The goal is to enhance your problem-solving skills and to prepare you thoroughly for the technical rounds of internship interviews.

### Daily Coding Questions

- **Day 1 to Day 45:** Each folder corresponds to a day in the 45-day plan, containing coding questions for that day. The questions range in difficulty and are selected to cover various aspects of programming and computer science fundamentals.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Day 1:** Begin your preparation by opening the Day 1 folder and attempting the coding questions provided.
2. **Code Daily:** Make it a habit to code every day. Consistency is key to mastering the concepts and becoming proficient in problem-solving.
3. **Check Solutions:** After attempting each question, compare your solutions with the suggested solutions provided in the repository. This will help you identify areas for improvement.
4. **Repeat:** Continue this process day by day, gradually advancing through the 45-day plan.
